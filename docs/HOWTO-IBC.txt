How to build, deploy, use IBC token transfer from one chain to another

1. Go to the docker env directory to build the primary docker image
$ cd docker/env && sh build.sh

2. Go to the ibc-tokentransfer/qadena folder to build the docker image of 2 chains
$ cd docker/ibc-tokentransfer/qadena && sh build-images.sh

3. Go to the ibc-tokentransfer folder to build relayer and run a docker-compose command
$ cd docker/ibc-tokentransfer && docker-compose -f tokentransfer.yml --profile go up

4. To verify if all build, images and containers are successful try these ff commands:
$ docker images

You should see something like:
qdnb                 latest    6d3110fbb7eb   2 days ago   6.2GB
qdna                 latest    27c9c407aefb   2 days ago   6.2GB

goignite              latest    391f3a021cdb   6 days ago   3.02GB

$ docker ps

You should see something like:

If you can see all this, then you're all set!

CLI commands that can be used inside a relayer:

# Go inside the relayer docker container
docker exec -it relayer bash

# Initialize relayer based on config and path directories
rly config init
rly chains add-dir configs
rly paths add-dir paths

# Restore the existing user on qadena chain
rly keys restore qdna alice "cinnamon legend sword giant master simple visit action level ancient day rubber pigeon filter garment hockey stay water crawl omit airport venture toilet oppose" --coin-type 60
rly keys restore qdnb bob "define envelope federal move soul panel purity language memory illegal little twin borrow menu mule vote alter bright must deal sight muscle weather rug" --coin-type 60

# List the chain and paths
rly chains list
rly paths list

# Link chain a (qdna) to chain b (qdnb)
rly tx link demo -d -t 3s

# Run the replay packets/acknowledgements
rly start demo

# Query balances on both chains
rly q balance qdna
rly q bal qdnb

# Do a IBC transfer from chain a to chain b
rly tx transfer qdna qdnb 10aqdn $(rly chains address qdnb) channel-0

# Query balances on both chains
rly q bal qdna
rly q bal qdnb

# Transfer back the transferred IBC token from chain b to chain a
rly tx transfer qdnb qdna 10transfer/channel-0/aqdn $(rly chains addr qdna) channel-0
