How to build, deploy, use IBC token transfer from one chain to another

1. Go to the docker env directory to build the primary docker image
$ cd docker/env && sh build.sh

2. Go to the ibc-tokentransfer/qadena folder to build the docker image of 2 chains
$ cd docker/ibc-tokentransfer-scrt/qadena && sh build-images.sh

3. Go to the ibc-tokentransfer folder to build relayer and run a docker-compose command
$ cd docker/ibc-tokentransfer-scrt && docker-compose -f tokentransfer.yml --profile go up

4. To verify if all build, images and containers are successful try these ff commands:
$ docker images

You should see something like:
scrt                 latest    6d3110fbb7eb   2 days ago   6.2GB
qadena                 latest    27c9c407aefb   2 days ago   6.2GB
relayer_go            latest    90b4c8b07d85   3 days ago   2.48GB
goignite              latest    391f3a021cdb   6 days ago   3.02GB

$ docker ps

You should see something like:

If you can see all this, then you're all set!

NOTE: BEFORE PROCEEDING, we need to create a new account on scrt network via these commands
$ docker exec -it scrt bash

Check the balance of scrt network pioneer

Pioneer
secret1ap26qrlp8mcq2pg6r47w43l0y8zkqm8a450s03

$ secretd q bank balances secret1ap26qrlp8mcq2pg6r47w43l0y8zkqm8a450s03

Recover bob account

$ secretd keys add bob --recover

Then paste: define envelope federal move soul panel purity language memory illegal little twin borrow menu mule vote alter bright must deal sight muscle weather rug

Send funds from pioneer to bob

$ secretd tx bank send secret1ap26qrlp8mcq2pg6r47w43l0y8zkqm8a450s03 secret1jgrqpljwraec04qqmg4wrhsaajjsn27yeghv2n 10000000000000uscrt --yes

Bob
secret1jgrqpljwraec04qqmg4wrhsaajjsn27yeghv2n

Check the balance of bob

secretd q bank balances secret1jgrqpljwraec04qqmg4wrhsaajjsn27yeghv2n

CLI commands that can be used inside a relayer:

# Go inside the relayer docker container
docker exec -it relayer bash

# Initialize relayer based on config and path directories
rly config init
rly chains add-dir configs
rly paths add-dir paths

# Restore the existing user on qadena chain
rly keys restore qadena ann "inherit rebel absorb diamond leopard lens approve deny balcony toast merry text metal pair diamond lumber gravity song liberty pumpkin goddess nature slush basic" --coin-type 60
rly keys restore scrt bob "define envelope federal move soul panel purity language memory illegal little twin borrow menu mule vote alter bright must deal sight muscle weather rug" --coin-type 529

# List the chain and paths
rly chains list
rly paths list

# Link chain a (qadena) to chain b (scrt)
rly tx link demo -d -t 3s

# Run the replay packets/acknowledgements
rly start demo

# Query balances on both chains
rly q balance qadena
rly q bal scrt

# Do a IBC transfer from chain a to chain b
rly tx transfer qadena scrt 10aqdn $(rly chains address scrt) channel-0

# Do a IBC transfer from chain b to chain a
rly tx transfer scrt qadena 10uscrt $(rly chains address qadena) channel-0

# Query balances on both chains
rly q bal qadena
rly q bal scrt

# Transfer back the transferred IBC token from chain a to chain b
rly tx transfer qadena scrt 10transfer/channel-0/uscrt $(rly chains addr scrt) channel-0

# Transfer back the transferred IBC token from chain b to chain a
rly tx transfer scrt qadena 10transfer/channel-0/aqdn $(rly chains addr qadena) channel-0
